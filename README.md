# u-headlessProcessing
Matlab Package to run Danuser Lab software externally without the GUI. Tools to automatically generate movieData files (representing single jobs that can be loaded into the GUI), and to run processing of movieData files (sequential or parallel) from the commandline. Suitable for high-throughput and compute cluster environments. Created initially for the u-inferforce package, but mostly compatible with other danuser lab packages.

IN-PROGRESS
Code will be uploaded to this repository shortly; a few bugs left, and some final checks to make sure it works smoothly with non u-inferforce packages.
